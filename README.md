# Search_the_web

This project tries to create web search add-ons for chatbots , however it can be modified for other uses

 *The wikipedia searcher can modified extensively and used extensively but it requires wikipedia module to be installed in py3(needs internet)

 *DuckDuckGo searcher can be modified extensively but duckduckgo wants to be credited when used in programs, so remember to credit it.. this program doesnt need any module installation requires py3 and internet

Happy Searching!!!!!
